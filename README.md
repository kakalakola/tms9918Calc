== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  We 
are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop our FOSS project. We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not
a good place to host FOSS projects.
